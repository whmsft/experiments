### History

Originally, It was fuelled by my quest for AI reading my school AI study material...
(yeah, I study AI here not CS, since std 8th, now I'm in 9th)

### Credits

For making me reach the bit of what I've reached, I would thank

* [@avivberri](https://github.com/avivberri) for making [DOMEENGINE](https://domeengine.com) Which makes quick prototyping extremely easy and with size efficiency.

* ChatGPT asking which I learned about how to reach the experiments
